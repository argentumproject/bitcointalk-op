[b]Features:[/b]
Argentum uses six cryptographic algorithms; 
- Scrypt with AUXPOW support (Merged Mining)
- SHA256D with AUXPOW support (Merged Mining)
- Lyra2REv2 (GPU)
- Myriad-Groestl (GPU/ASIC)
- Argon2d (CPU)
- Yescrypt (CPU/GPU)
- Max block size 10mb
- 3 ARG per block

[b]Production:[/b]
Blocks are discovered every 45 seconds and transactions are fully confirmed every 4.5 minutes. 64 Million total Argentums will be mined. Once this limit is reached, it is increased by 1.1% annually, the rate of human population growth.

[b]Security:[/b] 
Mined blocks mature after 100 confirmations[/center]

[b]Argentum Version 4.14.3[/b]
- Adds 4 new mining algorithms (Activates at block 2,977,000)
- Lyra2re2 (GPU)
- Myr-Groestl (GPU/ASIC)
- Argon2d (CPU)
- Yescrypt (CPU/GPU)

[b]Argentum Version 4.14.2[/b]
- These are just a few of the hundreds of enhancements with this new release

- BIP112 (CheckSequenceVerify) soft fork
- BIP146 Argentum will hard fork at block 2,977,000 (around March 13th 2018) to implement BIP146
- Signature validation using libsecp256k1
- Direct headers announcement (BIP 130)
- Automatically use Tor hidden services
- Notifications through ZMQ
- BIP9 softfork deployment
- Linux ARM builds
- Compact Block support (BIP 152)
- Hierarchical Deterministic Key Generation (HD wallets)
- Substantial improvments to the client load time. 

[b]Version 3.11.2[/b]
- Update the code base to Bitcoin version 11.2 (from Myriadcoin 11.3)
- Hard fork for coinbase maturity at Block 2,422,000. New coinbase maturity will be 100 confirmations.
- Up to date Gitian build scripts and setup guide
- BIP65 Soft Fork when ~>78% of nodes have upgraded
- Minimum protocol version is 1050000

[b]Version 2.4.4[/b]
- Minimum transaction fee and minimum relay transaction fee from 0.00500000 to 0.00050000
- Bring the dust limit in line with Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies. With a relay transaction fee of 0.00050000 the dust limit should be 0.00027300; anything less than that and the transaction will be rejected.
- Change the dust soft limit to 0.00050000. Any amount of ARG less than 0.00050000 will incur an additional fee of 0.00050000.

[b]Version 2.4.3[/b]
- Add checkpoint block
- Change minimum peer version to 2.4.1

[b]Version 2.4.2[/b]
- Change protocol version to 1050000

[b]Version 2.4.1[/b]] Very important update
- Disconnect obsolete versions

[b]Version 2.4.0 (September 18, 2016) Fork at block 2,032,000 [/b]
- Changes max sequential blocks found per algorithm from 3 to 6

Argentum was created mid 2013 with the following criteria:

[quote]
Argentum is fast, unique, and secure. We have learned from many of the past crypto-currencies and created one that can rival any. Argentum brings innovation and experimentation by combining interesting aspects of other crypto-currencies and adding unique features.

Argentum is designed to gain value over time and to be a rare commodity that is easily and quickly transferable. The innovation doesn't end there, Argentum is the first crypto-currency to increase transaction processing capabilities over those of bitcoin. With the Bank of Argentum, the ARG/DGC exchange, and other commodity related services on the way, there is a bright future for this coin.

Argentum is secure, rare, and unique. The combination of all its characteristics provide a:
1. Longterm stable investment
2. Growth potential based on services
3. Diversification into less risky crypto-currency
4. Secure quasi-instantaneous transaction processing[/quote]
[pre]Taken from the most active ARG BitcoinTalk threads here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=259436.msg2767706#msg2767706 & https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=231524.0.[/pre]

The original info is mostly defunct on those threads, hence this new ANN
Also in the very earliest original launch thread from the original developer AlphaC, there would seem to have been some kind of pre-mine which was used to pay for services rendered to Baritus. So for clarity I will state that there was a historical pre-mine at the beginning of what seems to have been around 200,000 ARG.

This pre-mine now will no longer matter as there would seem to be in the regions of over 3.5 million ARG locked in accounts that may be lost to the original holders.

We will move on from the past in a New Beginning for Argentum, eventually cutting ties with the original incarnation.


[b]Current short-term goals:[/b]

-Mining diversification - adding Lyra2REv2, Myr-Groestl, Argon2d, and Yescrypt

-Coinomi Mobile wallet (awaiting merge at Coinomi's repo) They will be more likely to add if you ask them to add it

-Merchant integration

-Poloniex

-Bittrex

-Shapeshift.io
